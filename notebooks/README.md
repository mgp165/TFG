# Notebooks
This directory contains the Jupyter notebooks on which different tasks are carried out.

## EDA
There is a notebook for each dataset where a very brief  EDA has been done.

## Models
In this folder are the main notebooks of the project, where the algorithms are executed and the models are discussed to achieve the best version of each one of them. Even those that are interpretable (LR, DT, LT, EBLR) are examined. More info about the notebook structuring in the [README](models/README.md) inside this folder.

## Examples
There are some practical examples made for the working memory or for trying commands of the new algorithms.

## Utils
It only contains the Python files with the functions used in the models notebooks for having a cleaner code.
