In this directory, the first step is to select the best model of each algorithm just by fitting the train data and varying:
  - Regression: the penalty term
  - Decision Tree: maximum depth
  - Random Forest:
  - RERF:
  - EBLR:

Then when we have the chosen model, we will re-fit it by hyperparameter tuning or scaling the data.
